# GMM Clustering Analysis

## Observations from the Output Plot

### 1. Cluster Separation
- The GMM has identified four clusters (0, 1, 2, and 3).
- The ellipses represent the covariance of the Gaussian components, indicating the spread of the clusters.
- Some clusters overlap significantly, suggesting that their separation might not be strong.

### 2. Feature Distributions
- The x-axis (`ratio_max_width`) and y-axis (`ratio_high_low`) suggest that most points are concentrated in a small range of values.
- There is one distinct cluster on the right side of the plot, which seems more isolated from the others.

### 3. Cluster Assignment Ambiguity
- There is a high density of points in the left portion of the plot, where multiple clusters overlap.
- This could indicate that GMM is struggling to clearly separate these regions, possibly due to feature similarity.

## Potential Improvements

### 1. Feature Scaling
- Standardizing or normalizing the features might improve cluster separation.

### 2. Additional Features
- If `ratio_max_width` and `ratio_high_low` alone are not enough for clear clustering, adding more features (e.g., `norm_Bt`) could improve results.

### 3. Different Covariance Type
- The current GMM model might be using a full covariance matrix, but testing `diag` or `tied` might help if the structure is not well captured.

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Adjusting the number of clusters (maybe reducing to 3?) or modifying initialization parameters could yield better separation.
